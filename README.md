# Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networking Coursework

This repository documents my MSc coursework focused on practical networking simulations, wireless network behaviour, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) concepts.

## Project Overview

The coursework involved designing, emulating, and analysing multiple networking scenarios using network emulation tools and packet analysis techniques. The objective was to understand real-world network behaviour, protocol performance, traffic flow, and network efficiency under different configurations.

## Key Implementations

### Wireless Network Emulation
- Designed and configured wireless network topologies using Mininet-WiFi
- Deployed multiple Access Points (APs) and mobile stations (STAs)
- Implemented realistic mobility models to simulate dynamic user movement
- Analysed connectivity, signal coverage, and handover behaviour

### Adhoc / MANET Networking
- Built infrastructure-less Adhoc network scenarios
- Evaluated routing protocols including OLSRD, BATMAND, and BATMAN_ADV
- Observed protocol performance based on latency, throughput, and packet delivery
- Compared behaviour under dynamic network conditions

### Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
- Developed SDN-based topologies using OpenFlow concepts
- Utilised ONOS controller for network management and visualisation
- Analysed centralised traffic control and forwarding behaviour
- Performed connectivity and traffic flow experiments

### Network Traffic Simulation & Analysis
- Conducted ICffic tests using ICMP (ping) and UDP streams
- Analysed packet-level behaviour using Wireshark
- Observed throughput, latency, packet loss, and jitter characteristics
- Studied traffic patterns under varying network loads

### Multicast Streaming Configuration
- Implemented multicast video streaming scenarios
- Validated bandwidth-efficient content delivery to multiple hosts
- Observed network efficiency compared to unicast transmission

## Tools & Technologies

Mininet-WiFi, SDN, OpenFlow, ONOS Controller, Wireshark, MANET Protocols
